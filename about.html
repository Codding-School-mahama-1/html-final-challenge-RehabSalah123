    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
        As a web development student, I am passionate about building functional, 
        responsive, and visually appealing websites. I am currently learning key 
        technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks like React and 
        Node.js, which allow me to create dynamic and user-friendly web applications. 
        Through hands-on projects and continuous learning, I am developing both front-end 
        and back-end skills, preparing myself for a career in full-stack development. 
        I enjoy problem-solving and staying updated with the latest trends in web design 
        and development, always striving to improve my code and deliver better user 
        experiences.
