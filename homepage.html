                <p>
                    As a web development student, I am passionate about building functional,
                    responsive, and visually appealing websites. I am currently learning key
                    technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks like React and
                    Node.js, which allow me to create dynamic and user-friendly web applications.
                    Through hands-on projects and continuous learning, I am developing both front-end
                    and back-end skills, preparing myself for a career in full-stack development.
                    I enjoy problem-solving and staying updated with the latest trends in web design
                    and development, always striving to improve my code and deliver better user
                    experiences.

        - Main content is organized into sections (About, Contact) with unique IDs for navigation and styling.
        - The About section introduces the site owner and their interests in web development.
        - The Contact section provides a way to reach out, including a mailto link for convenience.
        - The iframe area embeds both a YouTube video (for multimedia engagement) and about.html (to meet project
        requirements for embedding another HTML file).
        - The form area demonstrates proper use of (label) tags and input types for accessibility and user interaction.
        - The table area displays sample names, emails, and messages, using (th) for headers and
        (td) for data, fulfilling the requirement for at least three rows and columns.
        - (div) tags with class and id attributes are used throughout for layout organization and future CSS
        styling.
